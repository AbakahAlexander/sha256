# CUDA-Accelerated Cryptographic Security Suite

## Financial Fraud Detection, Bitcoin Mining, and Cryptographic Defense

This comprehensive security platform harnesses NVIDIA CUDA GPU acceleration to deliver real-time cryptographic operations at scale, integrating three powerful components: (1) a Financial Fraud Detection system capable of processing thousands of transactions per second with multi-dimensional anomaly detection, (2) a high-performance Bitcoin Miner demonstrating SHA-256 hashing at rates of 9+ million hashes per second, and (3) a CryptoGuardian module that monitors for side-channel attacks, timing attacks, and other cryptographic vulnerabilities. Built with a Python/Flask web interface, CUDA C++ for computational kernels, and interactive JavaScript visualization libraries, the suite demonstrates how GPU parallelization can transform traditionally CPU-bound cryptographic applications into high-throughput security solutions for financial institutions and blockchain systems.

### Financial Fraud Detection System

#### Transaction Simulation Engine

- Generates realistic financial transaction data across different user profiles
- Models normal behavioral patterns for retail, business, and high-value accounts
- Simulates location, amount, and frequency patterns specific to each user
- Injects anomalous transactions at configurable rates for testing

#### Anomaly Detection Algorithm

The system uses a multi-faceted approach to detect fraudulent activity:

- **Hash-Based Fingerprinting**: Each transaction is hashed using SHA-256 to create a unique fingerprint
- **Historical Pattern Analysis**: User-specific behavior profiles are maintained
- **Location Anomaly Detection**: Identifies transactions from unusual geographic locations
- **Amount Anomaly Detection**: Flags unusually large transactions based on user history
- **Frequency Anomaly Detection**: Detects unusual transaction timing patterns
- **Hash Pattern Analysis**: Examines similarities between transaction hashes

The detection algorithm assigns weighted anomaly scores based on multiple factors:
- Location anomaly contributes 30% to the final score
- Amount anomaly contributes 30% to the final score
- Frequency anomaly contributes 25% to the final score
- Hash pattern anomaly contributes 15% to the final score

#### Real-Time Processing Pipeline
