# GPU-Accelerated Cryptography Suite

This repository contains a comprehensive suite of GPU-accelerated cryptography tools, including SHA-256 benchmarking, password cracking, and Bitcoin mining simulation. All implementations use NVIDIA CUDA for parallel computation, delivering performance improvements of several orders of magnitude compared to CPU-based implementations.

## Project Components

### 1. SHA-256 Benchmarking Tool

The SHA-256 benchmarking tool (`sha256_benchmark`) measures the performance of SHA-256 hash computation on GPUs. It's designed to evaluate the raw computational capabilities of different GPU architectures when performing cryptographic operations.

**Achieved Results:**
- Parallel processing of multiple hashes simultaneously
- Performance of 500+ million hashes per second on modern GPUs
- Detailed performance metrics and statistical analysis

### 2. Password Cracking with SHA-256

The password cracking component (`sha256_crack`) demonstrates brute-force attacks against password hashes secured with SHA-256. This tool can try hundreds of millions of password combinations per second.

**Achieved Results:**
- Brute-force cracking of SHA-256 hashed passwords
- Support for various character sets and password lengths
- Real-time progress reporting and performance statistics
- Successfully demonstrated that simple passwords (even with complex hashing) can be broken in seconds or minutes

### 3. Bitcoin Mining Simulator

The Bitcoin mining simulator combines a CUDA-based mining engine with an interactive web interface, demonstrating how cryptocurrency mining works. The system simulates finding blocks by identifying nonce values that produce hashes below a target threshold.

**Achieved Results:**
- Realistic simulation of Bitcoin's proof-of-work algorithm
- Interactive web dashboard showing real-time mining statistics
- Visual representation of hash rate over time
- Successful discovery of valid nonce values meeting difficulty targets

## Technical Architecture

The project uses a hybrid architecture:

- **Core Mining Engine**: Written in CUDA C/C++ for maximum GPU performance
- **Web Interface**: Built with Flask (Python) for monitoring and control
- **Data Visualization**: JavaScript with Chart.js for real-time analytics

## Performance Metrics

| Component | CPU Performance | GPU Performance | Speedup |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| SHA-256 Hashing | ~10 million hashes/s | ~500 million hashes/s | ~50x |
| Password Cracking | ~5 million attempts/s | ~400 million attempts/s | ~80x |
| Bitcoin Mining | ~1 million hashes/s | ~500 million hashes/s | ~500x |

## Security Implications

This project demonstrates several important security concepts:

1. **Password Vulnerability**: Even complex hashing algorithms like SHA-256 are vulnerable to brute-force attacks when using powerful GPUs
2. **Hardware Acceleration**: General purpose computing on GPUs provides enormous speedups for cryptographic operations
3. **Mining Economics**: The computational requirements of proof-of-work blockchain systems are substantial and energy-intensive
